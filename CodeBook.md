## Code Book for Summarized Tidy Dataset produced from 'Accelerometer and Gyroscope dataset collected using Samsumg Smartphones' 

### Feature Selection 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Then, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation


Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

### Tidy Dataset

Finally, the average of each variable is calculated for each activity and each subject.

The complete list of variables of tidy dataset is given below:

| Variable           | Description
|--------------------|-----------------------
| subject            | People who participated in the experiment, labelled from 1 to 30.
| activity           | Six activities performed by the subject while measurements were taken. Activities are WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
| tBodyAcc-mean()-X  | Average of variable by subject and activity
| tBodyAcc-mean()-Y  | Average of variable by subject and activity
| tBodyAcc-mean()-Z  | Average of variable by subject and activity
| tBodyAcc-std()-X   | Average of variable by subject and activity
| tBodyAcc-std()-Y   | Average of variable by subject and activity
| tBodyAcc-std()-Z   | Average of variable by subject and activity
| tGravityAcc-mean()-X  | Average of variable by subject and activity
| tGravityAcc-mean()-Y  | Average of variable by subject and activity
